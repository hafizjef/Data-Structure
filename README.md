# BITP 1123 - Data Structure and Algorithm

This course will expose the students to data structures and algorithms. The basic concepts in __structure, class, array and pointer__
discussed in order to understand the fundamental of data structures and algorithms. The course focuses on data structure such as; __list,
stack, queue, tree, searching and hash while sorting, graph and heaps__ topics cover the algorithms. This also includes the algorithm
efficiency for _run time_. Pseude code and __C++__ programming language will be used in algorithm implementation.
